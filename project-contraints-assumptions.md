# Constraints and Assumptions

We've identified two kinds of constraints & assumptions relating to the project. There are some restrictions regarding the project and there are some assumptions and constraints to consider regarding the proposed system.

## Project constraints and assumptions

- No frameworks are allowed.
    Have to use the fundamental technologies to build the project.
- The project should be completed in one academic year.
- It's assumed that the workload is fairly divided among all team members to make sure everyone benefits from the project.

## System constraints and assumptions

- All the users must have an internet connection to connect to the system as this is a web-based system.
- Customers cannot cancel orders after the products are on the way.
- Assumed that users possess simple it and language skills to operate this system
- Assumed that all the employees have devices that are capable of using this web application.
- Assumes that while the System admin is the main user of the system, only employee management and analytic parts are available to the admin because all other responsibilities of the system are correctly divided among other user roles and giving all those features to the admin would only clutter the interface. We assume that in this system, the admin is not a user role that does everything.
