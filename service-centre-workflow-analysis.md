# Regarding Vehicle servicing and repairing

## Manual Workflow in center's POV when a customer brings a vehicle for a typical service

1. Admitting the vehicle
    - done by the security section
    - check appointment details
    - check the physical condition (issues in the painting/damages etc.)
    - customer fills in details about issues with the vehicle that he       experiences
    - a report based on these details will be sent to an engineer

2. Analyzing the vehicle
    - The engineer checks the report and assigns a foreman
    - Then the foreman takes the vehicle to a test drive
    - in the test drive, foreman checks breaks, suspension, and other technical aspects.
    - He generates a fault report
    - Technicians do a full inspection of the vehicle and provides a status report

3. Get customer approval
    - After analyzing status and fault report while also looking into previous history to determine what needs to be done in this servicing, foreman calculates a cost estimation
    - asks the customer if he/she wants to proceed with extra expenses for new parts

4. Servicing process
   - Technicians service the vehicle

5. After service checkup
   - foreman takes the vehicle for a test drive again and check the status of previously identified faults
   - if there is an issue still, consult with engineer

# Regarding auto parts selling (Spare parts,batteries, engine oil& lubricants, electronics,stickers & modifications etc.)

## How spare parts stock management & selling works

- Usually, only regular customers can reserve spare parts beforehand
- So regular customers can reserve some spare part to purchase it later
- Spare parts are identified by not only their part number but also a code based on the vehicle brand.
- Usually sellers analyze their weekly selling performance to get a idea on what items are demanding at the moment
- Some sellers even deliver spare parts to regular customers like service centers/technicians
- they keep all purchase records(customer details and what they've bought)
- for the same spare part, there are multiple manufacturer brands (Genuine, Japanese, Chinese, Thai etc.).They vary based on longevity and price.

## How other products selling and stock management works

 - More people order them online compared to spare parts
 - stocks are managed through a system which also allows to analyze sale performance,same as spare parts
 - Also keep purchase details
 - for products that offer warranty, also keep warranty details  


Based on these workflows, we've realized that a service centre which also sells spare parts and accessories should have following main roles

 - Security Staff
 - Foreman
 - Technician
 - Stock manager
 - Customer care staff
 - Billing staff
 - Administrator
